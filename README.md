Developed a ReactJS Single Page Application for demonstrating the current weather based on the inputs of city and country. The application also navigates to the location map based on the input values.
Example: If Espoo and Finland are passed as inputs, then the page displays the current weather position and a map is displayed with highlighting Espoo.
